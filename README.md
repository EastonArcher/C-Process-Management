# System Programming Process Management

Developed a system for the creation and supervision of multiple child processes within a unified parent process by using the fork() and wait() system calls. Each individual child process is tasked with outputting a 'hello' message, accompanied by its unique Process ID (PID), prior to concluding its execution. This project establishs a robust framework for efficient process management and communication within a computing environment.
