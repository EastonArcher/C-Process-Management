"# System-Programming-Process-Management" 
Part 1. Shell Experiences and Programming
You are asked to try Unix/Linux shell in this part of project.
Requirements:
1. Run the displayinfo.sh and greeting.sh scripts provided and report the result (i.e. using
shell redirection to produce output files and then submit output files).
2. Made two modifications to the greeting.sh script provided: 1) the script only shows a
greeting message when it’s morning, afternoon, or evening; please make a code
modification to show a greeting message “Hello [your login name]!” when it’s other than
morning, afternoon, or evening; 2) please output the greeting message to a file called
“greetingmsg”, and if this file already exists, then deletes the file first, then output the
message to this file.
3. Run the modified greeting.sh script on the HPCC server and report the result.
